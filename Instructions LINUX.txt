Download from: https://www.qt.io/download-open-source (you need to register in order to get a free license, use the open-source option when downloading).
Once you have the file (es. qt-unified-linux-x64-3.0.6-online.run):
# sudo chmod +x qt-unified-linux-x64-3.0.6-online.run 
# sudo ./qt-unified-linux-x64-3.0.6-online.run
Follow the instructions. Note that you need to select only:
- Qt creator
- In the latest version of Qt, the Qt gcc compiler component (unselect all Android, ARM, ...).

Install the libraries:
# sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev libqglviewer-dev-qt5 libboost-all-dev git doxygen

Open the file .pro with Qt, and the project should compile automatically (libraries should be in the default paths).

In linux the libraries should be located in the following directories (default paths for apt-get commands in ubuntu):
Eigen -> /usr/include/eigen3
Boost -> /usr/include/boost
libQGLViewer -> /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ (libQGLViewer.so or libQGLViewer-qt5.so)

You can change the system environment variables if you want to use other paths (libQGLViewer not supported, sorry):
EIGEN_HOME
BOOST_HOME

Now open the file .pro with Qt, and the project should compile.

If you have problem, try to execute install_ubuntu.sh!
