**********************
WARNING: we suggest you a Ubuntu/Linux virtual machine. Indeed the project will be evaluated in a linux environment with gcc. Note that CLANG compiler can have different warnings, compilation errors, ... from GCC. If you write a correct code (no undefined behavior and standard syntax) the result will be the same in every platform.
Also, setting up the compiling environment on macOS can be more difficult than Ubuntu.
**********************

Download from: https://www.qt.io/download-open-source (you need to register in order to get a free license, use the open-source option when downloading).
Execute the file.
Follow the instructions. Note that you need to select only:
- Qt creator
- In the latest version of Qt, the Qt CLANG compiler component (unselect all Android, ARM, ...).

Install the libraries:
# brew install git qt eigen boost llvm
# cd /usr/local/opt
# git clone https://github.com/GillesDebunne/libQGLViewer.git
# cd libQGLViewer/QGLViewer
# /usr/local/opt/qt/bin/qmake
# make 
# make install  
# echo "export QGLVIEWER_HOME=/usr/local/lib" >> ~/.bash_profile #here is installed QGLViewer.framework

In MACOSX the libraries can be located in the following directories:
Eigen -> /libs/include/eigen3/ or /usr/local/Cellar/eigen/3.3.4/include/eigen3/
Boost -> /libs/include/boost/ or /usr/local/Cellar/boost/1.66.0/include/
libQGLViewer -> /usr/local/lib

Or you can change the system environment variables:
EIGEN_HOME
BOOST_HOME
QGLVIEWER_HOME

Once libraries are set, open the file .pro with Qt, and the project should compile.

If you have problems, try to execute install_macos.sh!

If you are not able to compile on your own the project on macOS, download a virtual machine with Ubuntu and follow the instructions for linux.
